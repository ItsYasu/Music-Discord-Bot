Simple Discord Bot made in Java. 

This bot had been developed with JDA 5.0.

It has some AudioPlayer commands such as:
/play <URL> --> Play a song in a Voice Channel.
/next play next track
/volume set the volume of the AudioPlayer. 
/pause pause the current track

I'll add some other commands in future releases. Commands such as: OnTrackInfo (tittle, duration etc) and some other useful commands!
