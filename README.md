Simple Discord Bot made in Java. 

This bot had been developed with JDA 5.0.

It has some AudioPlayer commands such as:
/play <URL> --> Play a song in a Voice Channel.
/next play next track
/volume set the volume of the AudioPlayer. 
/pause pause the current track

I'll add some other commands in future releases. Commands such as: OnTrackInfo (tittle, duration etc) and some other useful commands!

--HOW TO SETUP--
1- Download the .jar from releases 
2- Make a config.properties file on the same folder that you have the .jar -> Be sure the file is named exactly config.properties 
3- Inside config.properties just add discord_api_key=INSERT_YOUR_API_KEY 
4- Just doble click on the jar once u added your api key and there you go!
